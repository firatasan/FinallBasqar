Thats a Basqar Study/Online University Web Page Test Project

We have planed this project with my group (you can see group memmbers at the end of this page) on JIRA and we have controlled all working steps with jira and agile methodology.

We have used java, cucumber, cross browser testing on this web page.

In my opinion that was great job and clean code.
